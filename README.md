TDS 2025 Q1

As a technical consultant at a major financial institution, you need to create an interactive presentation for the quarterly earnings report. This report will be shared with stakeholders and should demonstrate modern presentation capabilities.

Create a RevealJS presentation that includes:

Your email (24ds1000070@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) in the presentation
At least one slide written in Markdown
Animated elements using fragments
Code samples with syntax highlighting
Mathematical equations (e.g., financial formulas)
Speaker notes for presentation guidance
The presentation should be published on GitHub Pages.

# Algorithm Performance Optimization

Our engineering team achieved significant improvements:

**Time Complexity Reductions:**
- Search algorithm: $O(n^2) \rightarrow O(n \log n)$
- Database queries: $O(n) \rightarrow O(\log n)$
- Data processing: $\Theta(n) \rightarrow \Theta(\sqrt{n})$

**Result:** 40% reduction in processing time

---

# Growth Model Analysis

Customer acquisition follows exponential growth:

$$
C(t) = C_0 \cdot e^{rt}
$$

Where:
- $C_0 = 10,000$ (initial customers)
- $r = 0.12$ (monthly growth rate)
- $t$ = time in months

**Current customer base:** 34,500+ active users

---

# Technical Performance Metrics

**System Statistics:**
- Average API response time: $\mu = 42ms$
- Standard deviation: $\sigma = 8ms$
- System uptime: 99.98%
- Throughput capacity: 75,000 requests/second

**Scalability Formula:**
$$
\text{Capacity} = \frac{N \cdot P \cdot E}{L}
$$

---

# Revenue Projection Model

Our forecasting model uses:

$$
R(t) = R_0 \cdot (1 + g)^t + S(t)
$$

Where:
- $R_0$ = base revenue
- $g$ = growth rate (0.18)
- $S(t)$ = seasonal adjustment factor

**Q4 Target:** $52M (+15% QoQ)

---

# Risk Assessment

**Probability Analysis:**

$$
P(\text{success}) = 1 - \prod_{i=1}^{n}(1 - p_i)
$$

**Key Risk Factors:**
- Market volatility: 12%
- Technical debt: $O(n^2)$ complexity in legacy code
- Competition pressure: Moderate

---

# Conclusion

**Key Achievements:**
- Exceeded revenue targets by 12%
- Improved algorithmic efficiency to $O(n \log n)$
- Strong market position maintained

**Q4 Focus Areas:**
- Product innovation
- Market expansion
- Customer satisfaction (target NPS > 75)
