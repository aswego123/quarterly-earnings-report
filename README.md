As a technical consultant at a major financial institution, you need to create an interactive presentation for the quarterly earnings report. This report will be shared with stakeholders and should demonstrate modern presentation capabilities.

Create a RevealJS presentation that includes:

Your email (24ds1000070@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) in the presentation
At least one slide written in Markdown
Animated elements using fragments
Code samples with syntax highlighting
Mathematical equations (e.g., financial formulas)
Speaker notes for presentation guidance
The presentation should be published on GitHub Pages.
